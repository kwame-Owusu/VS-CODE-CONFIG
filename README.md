# VS code Config
this repo will act as storage for my configuration files for vscode which keeps it minimal and clean
it will have the settings.json and keybinds.json, when Coding I mainly use my keyboard and shortcuts/keybindings to do stuff.

Reminder that for APC UI++ in the settings.json you will have to have the extension installed for it to work as intended.

Here is an img of how it looks:
